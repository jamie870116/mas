# MS project
Aiming to implement a decentralized, LLM-driven multi-robot task planning and coordination system that is tolerant of unexpected events during execution.



## TODO
- [x] Built env with ai2thor    
- [ ] Set up  LLM workflow and Baselines: Centraulized (One time planning, Replanning loop)
- [ ] Test cases
- [ ] Decentualized planning
- [ ] Experiment

## Setup

### Env
I ran on conda environment with python=3.10.
Other dependecies are shown in `requirements.txt`


### Test
- config file path: `config/config.json`
- log file path: `logs/{task_name}`
- LLM api key file: `api_ley.txt` in root folder

- test env:
```python
python env/test_env_b.py
```

### LLM
#### One-time planning with Centralized LLM
>
> Given a high-level task:
> 1. **planner**: generate a list of subtasks to be completed by the robots
> 2. **editor**: edit the generated subtasks to ensure they are  feasible and do not conflict with each other.
> 3. **action planner**: generate a list of actions for each robot to complete the subtasks.
> 4. execute the actions generated by the action planner.

- When testing, change the content in config file
```python 
{   
    # change these three value
    "num_agents": 2,
    "scene": "FloorPlan1", 
    "task": "bring a tomato, lettuce, and bread to the countertop to make a sandwich",

}
```
and run:
```python
python env/llm.py
```

#### Centralized LLM + replanning
> 1. **Initial Planning**  
>    Remain the same as previous method: given task, let planner and editor generate a list of subtasks (this will be the open subtasks).
>
> 2. **Iterative Execution Loop** (until timeout or all open subtasks are completed)
>     1. Update open subtasks and completed subtasks.
>     2. Allocate subtasks to robot agents in the environment using LLM.
>     3. Break down each assigned subtask with LLM into a list of smaller available actions.
>     4. Execute one subtask per agent.
>     5. Verify if the subtask is completed using two methods:
>         - LLM-based verification (by observation of the environment)
>         - Rule-based verification
>     6. Replan: Similar to initial planning. Given the task and closed subtasks, let planner and editor generate a new list of subtasks (this will be the new open subtasks).

For testing, run:
```python
python env/llm_c.py
```
